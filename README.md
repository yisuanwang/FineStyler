## Some experimental results
The top left side is the original image and the bottom left side is the mask generated via CRIS using Stylized Objects. The rest are stylized images generated by different Stylized Content. Our style transfer results on various text conditions. Translated images have spatial structure of the content images with realistic textures corresponding to the text.
